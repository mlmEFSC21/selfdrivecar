Software Development 1 - Project - code your design

Using your design from the last assignment (or using an improved design), implement your design in whatever computer language you like to use. I only expect "skeleton" code. That is given a class, for instance, car, it perhaps has methods as forward, back, right, left, and stop. Each method should have only a print statement contained within the method so that we know it was called. For example, to drive around the block requires four left turns. So, the output should look something like this:

Forward, Left, Left, Left, Left, Stop

Come up with a simple driving around the block program. Something like "drive me to the store and back when I am finished shopping".

That's all you need to do. Upload the code with a sample output and a brief description of your driving plan like above.
